# NYC Traffic Analysis Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository presents the code and documentation for two interconnected analyses: taxi traffic patterns in New York City ("Taxi_Graph.ipynb") and the integration of subway station data into the traffic analysis ("Subway.ipynb"). The README file serves as a comprehensive guide to running the code and understanding the contributions of each group member.

## How to Run the Code
1. Download the csv datasets from the "data" folder
2. Download the three ipynb files from the "scripts" folder and the ipynb_checkpoints folder within "scripts"
3. Visualise the data and understand the analysis,conclusions and solutions written within the ipynb file.   

## Code Documentation

The codebase is well-documented for readability and understanding:

- **Comments:** Throughout the code, comments explain each step, making it easy to follow the logic and purpose.

- **Docstrings:** Functions and classes have docstrings describing their purpose, parameters, and return values.

- **Meaningful Variable Names:** Descriptive variable names enhance comprehension.

Project Abstract

A comprehensive study was conducted to understand traffic congestion in New York City. Instead of directly looking at traffic, researchers used data from taxi rides to figure out how bad the traffic was in different areas and times. The study included lots of details about each taxi ride, such as where it started and ended, how far it went, and how much it cost. This information helped the researchers understand how people travel and how much it costs to take a taxi. They also developed a new way to measure how well the roads were working.

The main idea was to create a map of the city using points for where people get in and out of taxis. Lines were drawn between these points to show the roads. The researchers figured out how well each road worked by looking at lots of taxi rides between the same starting and ending points. This gave them a way to show which roads were good and which ones were not.

One important finding was that longer taxi rides usually cost more, which makes sense. But they also saw that heavy traffic made fares higher because the trips took longer. This showed that how far you travel, how much time it takes, and how much it costs are all connected in the taxi system.

They also looked at where taxis and subway trains were most crowded. Manhattan stood out as the busiest place for both taxis and subways, showing it's a hub for business and activity. Taxis were used a lot in areas with more business, showing a link between economic centers and the need for transportation. They also found that tourists preferred taxis over subways, especially to and from airports like LaGuardia.

The study revealed that many people from areas like Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx take taxis to Manhattan for work every day. This showed the important role taxis play in helping people from the outskirts of the city get to and from work.

Looking at the subway lines, the researchers noticed that major ones run through Manhattan in a hub-and-spoke pattern. But there were not many direct subway connections between Queens and Brooklyn, making it less efficient for people to use the subway between those boroughs. This likely led to more people using taxis instead.

Based on what they found, the researchers suggest some ways to ease traffic in NYC. First, they think encouraging more people to use the subway is a good idea. Subways are space and cost-efficient, so making them more accessible and convenient could help. They also suggest promoting ridesharing, where people going the same way share a taxi to reduce traffic.

Finally, they believe it's important to focus on eco-friendly transportation to make the city more sustainable. By investing in green transport and improving infrastructure, they can make New York City's transportation more environmentally friendly.

In conclusion, the study gives a detailed look at traffic issues in New York City, using taxi data to understand the problems. The suggested solutions include promoting the subway, ridesharing, and sustainable transportation to help improve the city's traffic situation for both residents and visitors.
